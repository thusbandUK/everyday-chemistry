                <h1>Why Now Chemistry?</h1> 
                <p>Most of my job is working out what a student knows right now. Why is that so important? It tells me what they don’t know, how I can teach it and then whether they’ve understood it.</p>
                <p>Maybe a student tells me they don’t feel sure about ionic bonding, so I ask them what ionic bonding is. “When a metal donates an electron to a non-metal,” they usually say. “That’s how ions get made,” I say, “but it’s not quite what we mean by ionic bonding,” so then I ask them what they like to put on their chips, because everyone knows that. “Salt and vinegar,” they might say. </p>
                <p></p>Now I can use something they know to tell them something they don’t know. Table salt is mostly sodium chloride so I bring up a diagram of the lattice structure of one of the crystals they might sprinkle on their chips. We compare the different parts of the diagram. The sodium ions are positive but the chloride ions are negative. So what’s holding that crystal of salt together? The attraction between the positive and negative ions.</p>
                <p>Now can they tell me what ionic bonding is?</p>
                <p>“It’s the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.”</p>
                <p>Now they get it.</p>
                <h2>What do you need to know about me now?</h2>
                <p>I taught chemistry A-level and biology, physics and chemistry GCSE in mainstream schools for ten years. I have been working as a tutor for four years and I help my students get better grades. </p>
                <p>I quickly establish rapport with students and maintain a space where they feel safe to make mistakes, because there’s no learning science without making mistakes. However they answer questions, I always start my response with something positive about their ideas. A lot of the time I deliberately ask questions I expect students to get wrong, because that helps me to elicit misconceptions – common ways for complicated concepts to be misunderstood. But then I reassure students and tell them, I expected you to get that wrong and it would be weird if you didn’t, it’s just the way brains work. </p>
                <p>I drill the basics to promote higher order thinking. I highlight pieces of information that students need to commit to memory and then I advise them how to achieve that. In every session I will ask them questions to check how easily they can recall that information from memory. That’s important because the less they work to recall the basics, the more brain capacity they have available to think their way through difficult questions. And I give them plenty of opportunities to practise exam questions. Whenever we hit an obstacle, I break it down into simpler questions that they can answer. </p>
                <p>I am fully certified. I completed my chemistry degree at the University of Sheffield and my teacher training at the University of Cambridge, where I extended the qualification into a Masters degree in science education. Also I am registered with the Disclosure and Barring Service and maintain an up-to-date DBS certificate. You can ask to see all my certificates as well as a set of verified testimonials. </p>
                <p>I’m also a science author who has published a popular science book called The Chemistry of Human Nature, as well as various articles for The Mole and ChemMatters, aimed at engaging teenage chemistry students. </p>
                <p>I’ve got a great track record of helping students feel more confident, not only in chemistry A-level and GCSE but also biology and physics GCSE. Scroll down to inquire about lessons now.</p>
